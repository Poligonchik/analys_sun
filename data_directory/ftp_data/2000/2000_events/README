May 12, 1998

NOTES from May 9, 1998:
The format of the Solar Event Lists was changed to include a standard 
SEC style header. The format of the event record lines did not change.

A list of the current UT day is now available. It is updated every 30 minutes. 


                             SOLAR EVENT LISTS

This directory contains daily preliminary lists of solar events. The solar 
event reports received at SEL throughout the day are edited by the duty 
forecaster to remove incomplete and duplicate reports. This list contains 
one line for each event reported. 

The list is updated every 30 minutes throughout the day. The lists for the
past 3 days are recreated daily between 0300 and 0330 UT to pick up any late
additions or changes.

A subset of these lists, called the "energetic" events is included in the 
daily "Solar Geophysical Activity Summary (SGAS)" report and the 
"Energetic Events" list in SEL's WEEKLY publication.

The sample list below shows typical event reports. The format is fixed, 
80 columns wide, with standard headers. The fields are described below. 

If no events are reported a single line is shown
  NO EVENT REPORTS.

The SEC compiles this list from preliminary data as provided by the 
contributing stations. Incorrect, missed, and incomplete reports are possible.


Your comments and suggestions are welcome. 
Thank you,

The first line is the filename.
The second line indicates the date/time the list was created.
The third line contains the date of the data. Each file (list) contains one 
   UT day of data.


Event - This is an arbitrary event number assigned by SEL. It groups several
        reports into a single event, as determined by the SEL forecaster.
+     - A plus sign (+) after the event number indicates that more than one 
        report was received for this event, and the forecaster has selected 
        this report to represent those received. 

Begin, Max, End  - 
        The UT Time (UT) of the beginning, maximum, and end of the event as 
        reported by the observing site. "////" indicates a missing time. The 
        UT day of the event's begin time is the UT day of the list. The UT day 
        of the maximum and/or end times may or may not be the same as the begin 
        time. Most solar events are several hours in duration. If the maximum 
        or end time is less than the begin time, then assume the times are for 
        the next UT day. A single letter can proceed a Begin, Max, or End time.
        A=after, B=before, U=uncertain. For example the begin time A0146 means
        the event began after 0146.

        The begin time of an x-ray event is defined as the first minute, in a 
        sequence of 4 minutes, of steep monotonic increase in 0.1-0.8 nm flux. 
        The x-ray event maximum is taken as the minute of the peak x-ray flux. 
        The end time is the time when the flux level decays to a point halfway 
        between the maximum flux and the pre-flare background level. 

Obs   - The reporting observatory.

Q     - Quality
        For radio bursts at fixed and sweep frequencies, and for storms, this 
        shows the quality of the data
                       C = Corrected report
                       G = Good 
                       U = Uncertain
        For optical flares, this shows the quality of observing conditions, 
        from 1 to 5, where:  1 = very poor and 5 = excellent
        
        X-ray events have a quality of 5 (meaning excellent).

Type  - Type of report, (see the Glossary in the "Welcome" directory for 
        definitions). 
          BSL = Bright surge on the limb
          DSF = Filament disappearance
          EPL = Eruptive prominence on the limb
          FIL = Filament
          FLA = Optical flare observed in H-alpha 
          FOR = Forbush decrease (cosmic ray decrease))
          GLE = Ground-level event (cosmic ray increase)
          LPS = Loop prominence system
          PCA = Polar cap absorption
          RBR = Fixed-frequency radio burst
          RNS = Radio Noise Storm
          RSP = Sweep-frequency radio burst
          XRA = X-ray flare

Loc/Frq - Location or frequency.
	Location is in degrees latitude, north or south, and degrees longitude,
        east or west, from central meridian. The location is the spherical, 
        heliographic coordinates of the solar region, as a distance in degrees 
        from a line extending from the solar equator (heliographic latitude), 
        and distance in degrees from a line extending from the north solar 
        rotational pole to the south solar rotational pole through the center 
        of the solar disk, as viewed from Earth (central meridian) in H-alpha.

        Frequencies are in Mhz.

Particulars - Additional information from the report, chosen on the basis of 
        the report type.
